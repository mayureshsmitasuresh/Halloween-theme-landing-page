## What I Built

For this challenge, I created a **Halloween-themed landing page** inspired by spooky aesthetics like haunted houses, glowing pumpkins, and foggy night skies. The page features **interactive elements** including animated stars, glowing buttons, and a festive footer with a Halloween color palette. I focused on **fun, immersive UI design** while keeping it fully responsive and user-friendly.

## Journey
Building this landing page was a **fun and creative challenge**. I experimented with CSS animations to bring **floating stars and fog effects** to life and used **custom fonts and colors** to enhance the spooky mood.

Some key things I learned and implemented:

* **CSS animations** for stars, fog, and glowing buttons.
* **Parallax effect** background image
* **Responsive Modal** press R to open and EXC to close
* **Responsive design** that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* **Custom fonts** to create a Halloween vibe.
* Layering elements with **z-index and transparency** to add depth to the page.

I’m particularly proud of the **Interactive Invitation Section**, where the glowing links and Halloween color palette create a festive feel without overwhelming the main content.

Next steps I hope to implement:

* Adding **scroll-triggered animations** for elements appearing as you scroll down.
* **Sound effects** for a more immersive Halloween experience.
* Integrating **AI-generated spooky text** for dynamic landing content.
* Add a backend functionalities to interact with database and servers 

Big thanks to the **Frontend Challenge team** for hosting this event and inspiring developers to get creative! I really enjoyed working on vanilla CSS after so long. 🥂
